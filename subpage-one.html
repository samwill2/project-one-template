Located in Montana on the Canadian United States border Glacier Park is a 1,013,322 acre park in the Rocky Mountains. The park has over 700 miles of hiking trails. Named after the 35 glaciers that reside in the park, 25 of which are still considered active this park has many beautiful sites to see and is said to be the most beautiful during the summer months. But due to climate change Glacier park is being hit with slower glacier growth as well as melting causing many glaciers to melt and not have a chance to regrow during the winter months.</p>
