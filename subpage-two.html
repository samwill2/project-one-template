Created Lake is located in southern Oregon ( Klamath County, Oregon) and is the only national park currently in Oregon. The lake it self was formed by a volcanic eruption that caused the collapse of a tall volcano peak. The lake is known for his crystal blue color which comes from the way the lake was filled by rain and snow water, making the water almost completely pure. The lake has a small island, called Wizard island which can be visited by a ferry during certain parts of the year.
The lake is set so high up, 1,883 m that their is year around snow despots. </p>
